## Poverty Mapping for Niger


The machine learning models  and direct estimates for poverty headcount (FGT0) at non-representative area levels: region (admin level 1), provinces (admin level 2), and communes (admin level 3) were calculated by using aggregated means from the EHCVM-2021 at the household level (3227 households) and the Landsat 8-C2-SR 2022 georeferenced variables at the settlement level (70,238 settlements). Direct estimates were also calculated for every geographical level of disaggregation, including the ones where the EHCVM-2021 is representative (national, urban/rural, and regional level).
